# GNN_HIV_Classification

Task : Binary Classification whether molecules are suitable HIV inhibitors

- Some Specific inihibit of human cell block block HIV virus
- HIV : Try to connect with recept of human cell
- Inhibitor : Blocking those recpetors
  -> cell stays unharmed

DataSet : 80,000 molecules with {smile string, inhibit, HIV}

1. Build Geometric DataSet by torch geometric
2. Build a Graph Neural Network
3. Generating Molecules with Generative GNN Models
4. Deployment and UI with Streamlit
5. Explainable AI on Graphs
